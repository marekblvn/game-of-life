## Game of Life
#### What is the Game of Life?
The Game of Life, also known as Conway's Game of Life or simply Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

#### What is this project?
This is a free-time project I made in 2023. The goal was to create the cellular automaton in JavaScript using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). The project deployment is available [here](https://marekblvn.github.io/game-of-life/).
#### Controls
- **Live and dead cells**
  - Live cells are <ins>white</ins>, dead cells are *black*.
- **Pausing / resuming the simulation**
  - You can pause or resume the simulation by pressing `Enter`
- **Drawing live cells**
  - While the simulation is paused, you can make cells live (paint them white) by holding left mouse button while hovering over the dead (black) cells.
  - While the simulation is paused, you can make cells dead (pain them black) by holding `Backspace` while hovering over live cells.
- **Restarting the simulation**
  - The simulation can be restarted by refreshing the page. There currently is no other way of reloading, since the page refreshing method is sufficient.
